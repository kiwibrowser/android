PASS Performance interface: operation mark(DOMString)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for mark(DOMString) on Performance
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMarks(DOMString)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for clearMarks(DOMString) on Performance
PASS Performance interface: operation measure(DOMString, DOMString, DOMString)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for measure(DOMString, DOMString, DOMString) on Performance
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMeasures(DOMString)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for clearMeasures(DOMString) on Performance
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "mark(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling mark(DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "clearMarks(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMarks(DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "measure(DOMString, DOMString, DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling measure(DOMString, DOMString, DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "clearMeasures(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMeasures(DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
Harness: the test ran to completion.
