This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) from have-local-offer state should reset back to stable state assert_equals: expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) from stable state should reject with InvalidStateError assert_throws: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType." that is not a DOMException InvalidStateError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 11
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) after setting answer description should reject with InvalidStateError assert_throws: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType." that is not a DOMException InvalidStateError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 11
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should ignore invalid sdp content and succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
