This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test driver
PASS Partial interface UIEvent: original interface defined
PASS Partial dictionary UIEventInit: original dictionary defined
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface object length
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface object name
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: attribute firesTouchEvents
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for firesTouchEvents property on InputDeviceCapabilities
FAIL InputDeviceCapabilities interface: attribute pointerMovementScrolls assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "pointerMovementScrolls" expected true got false
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for pointerMovementScrolls property on InputDeviceCapabilities
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities must be primary interface of new InputDeviceCapabilities
PASS Stringification of new InputDeviceCapabilities
PASS InputDeviceCapabilities interface: new InputDeviceCapabilities must inherit property "firesTouchEvents" with the proper type
FAIL InputDeviceCapabilities interface: new InputDeviceCapabilities must inherit property "pointerMovementScrolls" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "pointerMovementScrolls" not found in prototype chain
PASS UIEvent interface: attribute sourceCapabilities
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for sourceCapabilities property on UIEvent
Harness: the test ran to completion.
