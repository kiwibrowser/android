// Requests the receiver to provide a favicon image for |URL|. A
// FaviconAttributes instance with non-nil properties is synchronously returned
// for immediate use. |completion| is called asynchronously with a
// FaviconAttribues instance if appropriate. For example, a default image may be
// returned synchronously and the actual favicon returned asynchronously. In
// another example, the image returned synchronously may be the actual favicon,
// so there is no need to call the completion block.
